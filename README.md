# UnityDev: LogConsole

`LogConsole` is an advanced console for in-game logging system. It supports persistense, filtering,
records grouping, and many more.

The main branch doesn't have a bootstrap code that would install this plugin into the game. In
different games different approaches may be needed. Check the branches for the specific game.

To install the plugin into the game, call `PluginLoader.Start` as soon as posible after the
application start.
